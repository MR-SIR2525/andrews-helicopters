These are helicopters extracted and improved from (['Survival Helicopters v1.5' by yimmplay](https://mcpedl.com/survival-helicopters-v1-5-4-new-helicopters-and-hydrogen/))

### Using the helicopters
- Buy the helicopters from the weaponsmith villager. He can sell the helicopters and the fuel but you'll have to craft the key (need blackstone).
- In the cockpit, look up to ascend and look down to descend.
- For now, just the Apache and Chinook are included.
  - The missiles don't work on the Apache for now
  - The Chinook can carry villagers. Look for "Load Villagers" and "Unload Villagers" in the crafting table.
- They are a little buggy with two players riding in the same helicopter.
