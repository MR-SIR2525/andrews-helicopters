These are helicopters extracted and improved from (['Survival Helicopters v1.5' by yimmplay](https://mcpedl.com/survival-helicopters-v1-5-4-new-helicopters-and-hydrogen/))

### Using the helicopters
- Buy the helicopters from the weaponsmith villager. He can sell the helicopters and the fuel but you'll have to craft the key (need blackstone).
- Helicopters won't despawn
- In the cockpit, look up to ascend and look down to descend.

For now, just the Apache and Chinook are included.
