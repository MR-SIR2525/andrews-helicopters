## How to download
Go the [Releases section](https://github.com/MR-SIR2525/andrews-helicopters/releases) and scroll to the "assets" section of the latest release.

- Download and double click the .mcpack files and Minecraft should import them automatically. 
    - If it says duplicate pack detected, but you still want to reinstall it, go to Minecraft's Settings, scroll all the way down to Storage, then find the pack you want to delete (in this case the helicopter pack).
    - If they don't auto-import, change the ".mcpack" to ".zip" and then extract and put the files in the Minecraft directory, in the behavior and resource pack folders.

## Using the helicopters
- Craft the helicopters in the crafting table, or **buy** them from the weaponsmith villager. He can sell the helicopters and the fuel but you'll have to craft the key (need blackstone from the nether).
- You must use a key to turn them on/off. 
- In the cockpit, look up to ascend and look down to descend.
- For now, just the Apache and Chinook are included.
  - The missiles don't work on the Apache for now
  - The Chinook can carry villagers and other mobs. Look for "Load Villagers" and "Unload Villagers" in the crafting table for loading villagers. Use a boat to load other mobs and a torch to unload.
- They are a little buggy with two players riding in the same helicopter.


## Known issues
- Sometimes if pilot gets out of a helicopter while there is a passenger (player), the pilot won't lose their pilot tag so the helicopter will still respond to the original pilot looking up and down if they are right next to the helicopter.
- propellers might stop spinning visually if you don't move anywhere after takeoff
- Loading boats in the Chinook can make the Chinook not able to take off sometimes. To fix, unload mobs and reload them in.
- When loading boats with passengers into the Chinook, sometimes the passengers are separated visually from the boat and it's kind of buggy, and leads to the problem above. Fix the same way, or don't load boats into the heli.
