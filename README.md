### How to download
Go the [Releases section](https://github.com/MR-SIR2525/andrews-helicopters/releases) and scroll to the "assets" section of the latest release.

### Using the helicopters
- Craft the helicopters in the crafting table, or **buy** them from the weaponsmith villager. He can sell the helicopters and the fuel but you'll have to craft the key (need blackstone).
- You must craft a key to turn them on/off. 
- In the cockpit, look up to ascend and look down to descend.
- For now, just the Apache and Chinook are included.
  - The missiles don't work on the Apache for now
  - The Chinook can carry villagers. Look for "Load Villagers" and "Unload Villagers" in the crafting table.
- They are a little buggy with two players riding in the same helicopter.
